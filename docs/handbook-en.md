# Genlib Desktop – Full Handbook (TODO)

This is a placeholder for the English handbook.

- TODO: Translate `docs/handbok-sv.md`
- Keep the same headings and image placeholders
- Ensure the section about the file-based model vs traditional genealogy apps is included
- Mention Genlib Desktop as a complement to existing genealogy software
