# Genlib Desktop – Quick Start (TODO)

This is a placeholder for the English onboarding guide.

- TODO: Translate `docs/onboarding-sv.md`
- Keep the same headings and image placeholders
- Ensure the “file-based shell” vs traditional genealogy programs section is included
- Mention Genlib Desktop as a complement to existing genealogy software
