## Who is it for?
Genlib Desktop is built for genealogists who want to collect people, relationships, documents, and photos in a safe, local, and structured way—without needing a server or cloud service.

## What problem does it solve?
- Brings all your family research into one place
- Organizes documents, photos, and notes
- Makes it easy to see relationships and family trees
- Simple backups so nothing gets lost
- Keeps your files accessible in the file system—easy to archive and share even with people without genealogy software

## How is it different from traditional genealogy programs?
Genlib Desktop is a **complement** to traditional genealogy software and works as a **shell over your own files**. Your documents and images are stored in a clear folder structure in the file system, not in a locked format. That means you:

- can archive and distribute your material without special software
- keep a consistent storage strategy over time
- avoid being locked in to a single tool or vendor

## 5 minutes to your first family database

### 1) Start Genlib Desktop
